# Drum-kit
This project is an interactive Drum Kit web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows users to play different drum sounds by either clicking the buttons on the screen or pressing corresponding keys on their keyboard.

**Overview**
The Drum Kit is a fun, browser-based application that mimics a real drum kit. Each button on the screen corresponds to a different drum sound, and the same sounds can be triggered by pressing specific keys on your keyboard. The project highlights my ability to create interactive and responsive web applications using core web technologies.

**Features**
1. Interactive Buttons: Users can click on the on-screen buttons or use keyboard keys to play different drum sounds.
2. Key and Click Events: The app listens for both keyboard and mouse events to trigger the drum sounds.
3. Button Animation: Buttons animate when pressed, providing a visual feedback to users.
4. Custom Sound Effects: Each button/key is associated with a unique drum sound, making the experience engaging.

**Technologies Used**
1. HTML5: Structure of the web page.
2. CSS3: Styling and layout of the drum kit interface.
3. JavaScript (with DOM manipulation): Event handling, sound playback, and animations.

**Usage**
1. Open the index.html file in your web browser to start playing the drum kit.

2. Click on the buttons or press the corresponding keys (W, A, S, D, J, K, L) to play different drum sounds.
